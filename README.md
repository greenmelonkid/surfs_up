# Surfs_up

## Resources

Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3, Python 3.7.6

## Overview

W. Avy wants to open a surf shop and ice cream business but wants to make sure 
that both shops will be profitable year-round. The purpose of this analysis is to 
examine the temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu to see if 
they are comparable in both months when the weather is different.

## Results

Three key differences in weather between June and December:

- The minimum temperature in June is low at 64 degrees Fahrenheit, but in December it is
much lower at 56 degrees Fahrenheit.

- The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees Fahrenheit, and in December it
is 83 degrees Fahrenheit. 

- The average temperature for days in June is about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, while
December's average temperature was about 71 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Summary

If I were W. Avy, based on the results, I would think it was a good idea to have both 
a surf shop and an ice cream shop open year-round. Even though the temperatures can get
a bit lower in the colder months, the warmer weather in December, which seems to be 
often, is almost as warm as the days in June. One thing I would add next time to check
other aspects of weather, might be to also check on how often it rains in both months. 
I would also add a query that measures hurricane possibilities in those months.
